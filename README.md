# XSeed guest agent (Windows)
- Runs at the host PC to provides automation for XSeed gaming service.

# Dependencies
- AutoHotKey to compile the .ahk file to .exe 
<!-- - Node v16 (for utilities with X509Certificate) -->
- Node (Tested on v16). Dont require v16 anymore as deps on X509Certificate is removed.

# Usage 
- use autoHotKey to compile the .ahk code to .exe 
- Node `pkg` package to compile .js code to windows .exe 
```
npm run buildWindows
```
- Open Run (Windows + R), and type `shell:startup` to open the start up folder
- Place a shortcut of the compiled .exe in the startup folder

# Limitation
- Currently cant generate valid crypto key pair. So a valid key pair generated by authentic android client is used as a seed key pair. Can still use this key pair to pair with the server.

# TODO 
- Integrate with AHK using node-ahk, so as to remove the .ahk script 
- Auto open firewall
- Currently assuming PC has IPv6. Maybe supports IPv4 soon? 
- Generate key pair that is compatible with GFE.
